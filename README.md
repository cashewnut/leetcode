## 题目描述
### #1. [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/)
Given an array of **integers**, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

> **Example**:
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

> Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].

### #2. [Add Two Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/description/)
You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.
>**Example**

>**Input**: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
**Output**: 7 -> 0 -> 8
**Explanation**: 342 + 465 = 807.
